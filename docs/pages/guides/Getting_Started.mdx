Assuming you've already created your bot, make sure you have Node.js installed (version 16 or greater is required). 
Senutila uses pnpm, for dependencies, so install it with `npm i -g pnpm`. Most `pnpm` commands work similarly to `npm`'s commands, so just prepend a '`p`' to commands you'd use `npm` for.
