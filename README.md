# Senutila

A Discord bot framework, focused on providing a great developer experience. Also better than `discord.js`.

## Example

See [example/bot.ts](https://github.com/edazpotato/senutila/blob/main/example/bot.ts) for example usage.

## Other notes

-   Node.js version 16 or greater is required.
-   Senutila uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependencies. Install it with `npm i -g pnpm`, and then use all npm commands like normal, except with a prepended p character.
